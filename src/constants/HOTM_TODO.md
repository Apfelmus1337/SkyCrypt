Pickaxe abilities have yellow title if not selected, green if selected... plus bottom row of lore:

"(yellow) Click to select!"
"(green) SELECTED."

Pickaxe cooldowns depend on Peak of the Mountain!

Maxed perks have "(green) UNLOCKED." as bottom lore line

Nodes will always contain Special0 (peak of the mountain), even right after the reset (so with no other perk). It will display an empty HOTM but with Peak in the middle.
Should be fine once we add locked perks in semi-opacity or something.

Predict SkyMall active effect? (and display in the perk lore)
